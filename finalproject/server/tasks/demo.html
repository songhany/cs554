        <ol>\n
            <li>Start by making the tomato
                sauce.Finely
                chop 1 onion.Peel 600g of tomatoes with a serrated peeler. Chop the peeled tomatoes into small pieces.
            </li>
            \n
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a sauce pan. </li>
            \n
            <li>Add the chopped onions.</li>
            \n
            <li>
                Add a
                pinch of
                Pimenton de la Vera (Dulce), which is Spanish smoked sweet paprika. I used 1/4 teaspoon.
            </li>
            \n
            <li>Add
                more
                if you prefer the sauce to be spicy.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the onions mixture and stir
                well
                to combine.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add 1 fresh bay leaf. I used 2 dried pieces here because I couldnt find fresh
                ones.
            </li>
            \n
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of sugar andd salt and pepper to taste. I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4
                teaspoon
                of ground black pepper. Adjust seasoning to taste.Cover the sauce pan and reduce the heat to a
                medium-low
                and let the tomato mixture simmer gently till it reduces to a sauce like consistency.In the meantime,
                make
                the meatballs by adding 1/2 an onion to a food processor.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add 2 cloves of garlic. I used 1
                tablespoon of minced garlic. Process till the onions and garlic are finely chopped.Sweat the
                onion-garlic
                mixture in a frying pan with some olive oil. I just realised that I had missed this step. The meatballs
                still tasted great.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add the onion-garlic mixture to 500g ground beef in a mixing bowl.Slice
                off
                the crust of 4 slices of white bread.
            </li>\n
            <li>Cut the soft white bread into small cubes of 1cm all
                round.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add the chopped bread to the beef mixture.

            </li>\n
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley. Use
                Italian flat parsley where possible. I couldnt find any, so I used English parsley.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add 1
                large
                egg.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste. I used approximately 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of
                black
                pepper.
            </li>\n
            <li>Mix well to combine.Shape the meat mixture into balls that are slightly bigger than
                the
                size of a golf ball size.
            </li>\n
            <li>Roll the meat tightly to form meatballs.

            </li>\n
            <li>Add 3/4 cup of
                olive
                oil to frying pan. The layer of oil should be approximately 3/4cm in the pan.
            </li>\n
            <li>Put the pan on
                medium-high heat and add the meatballs to the oil. Gently roll them around in the oil to brown all
                surfaces
                and ensure even cooking.When the meatballs are a deep golden brown, remove them from the frying pan and
                set
                aside.The tomatoes-onion mixture should have reduced to a sauce consistency now. You can use a hand
                blender
                to puree the mixture. Or leave the small bits of tomatoes and onions as they are.
            </li>\n
            <li>Add the
                meatballs to the tomato sauce and let the meatballs warm through.
            </li>\n
            <li>Garnish with more chopped
                parsley.
            </li>\n
        </ol>\n
